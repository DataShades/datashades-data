## What is this repository?

This repository holds a current snapshot of datashades data, and a historical record of snapshots over time.

## What is in the data?

Datashades.info provides a publicly-accessible index of metadata and statistics on CKAN data portals across globe. Data is gathered on portal users, datasets, resources, organisations, tags and plugins for each portal that can be accessed. As the index is refreshed, old data is kept in a historical index.

## What can I do with the data?

- Analyse the frequency and volume of public data releases
- Analyse implicit and explicit taxonomies of data via "Organisations" and "Tags"
- Analyse open data portal functionality via installed CKAN extensions

## What other data could we collect in the future?

- Data accessibility
- Data quality
- Topical extraction
- Other data points similar to the [Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/), but via programmatic analysis of public data portals

## Amazing! How can I contribute?
